; NHL '95 SNES player frame groups (SPF): equates only, no bytes. A frame number indexes
; FrameTileSource / FrameBankLayout (1060 frames, tiles in banks $C6-$CC); the SPA lists and the code write
; frames as SPFgroup+n. Names are 94S's for the frames of the same job, else 95 Genesis's. The order follows
; 95 Genesis's frame sheet up to $29D, then some groups move. Frame slots not in a group are empty, except
; $312 and $319, the first frames of SPAflip, which sit alone in an empty run.
